            <h2>Reflection 1: HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>
                Since HTML is the standard language used to give the fundamental structure of a webpage, 
                learning it has been an enjoyable experience. I gained a better understanding of how 
                developers produce a user friendly experience throughout this lab by practicing content 
                organization using semantic elements like &lt;header&gt; and &lt;article&gt;. When I ran 
                into errors with closing tags and indentation, I used the W3C Validator to pinpoint the 
                mistakes and manually adjusted my code in VS Code to fix them. I used MDN Web Docs and 
                the course lecture slides as my main resources to finish the assignment. Overall, I'm 
                excited to dive into more complex web development ideas in order to expand on this 
                structural basis that I'm slowly creating.

            <h2>Reflection 2: CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>
                In this module, I learned how to use CSS to separate a website's design from its structural content. 
                It was interesting to see how changing just one external stylesheet could instantly transform the 
                entire look of my HTML page (Look at my neon headings!). I practiced using different selectors like 
                IDs and classes to target specific elements for unique styling. One challenge I faced was ensuring 
                my colors had enough contrast to remain readable when using a dark theme. Overall, I feel much more 
                confident in my ability to create visually appealing web pages using standard CSS practices.
