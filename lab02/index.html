            <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
            <p>
                Learning HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, 
                is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, 
                allowing developers to organize content and create links between different pages. With HTML, you can add headings, 
                paragraphs, images, and other elements to your website, making it visually appealing and accessible for all users.

              evolve when we move into styling and advanced layouts! I learned a good bit from these sites:
